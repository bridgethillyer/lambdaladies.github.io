Lambda Ladies is an online community for anyone who identifies as a girl or woman and is interested in [functional programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Complete beginners are welcome.

The group was [formed by five functional programmers in March 2013](http://www.lambdaladies.com/2013/05/04/the-lambda-ladies-story/). The main way members communicate is online, via a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lambda-ladies-functional) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lambdaladies). In-person meetups and workshops are organised through these online channels.

This website is [open source](https://github.com/lambdaladies/lambdaladies.com). You are welcome to help us improve it.
