Lambda Ladies is an online community for anyone who identifies as a girl or woman and is interested in functional programming. We are emphatically queer & trans friendly.

We welcome and encourage: beginner-level questions; intermediate-level questions; expert-level questions; calls for proposals & papers; invitations to IRL meetups, conferences, and bowling parties; descriptions of projects you're working on or excited about; announcements of your achievements (more of these please!); job & scholarship postings; reviews of conferences, languages, programs and workplaces; encouragement and advice of all stripes; links to blog posts, papers, and outside discussions; rants, musings, funny stories, corny jokes, and many other kinds of posts! Non-members may pass along job postings by sending them to <lambda-ladies-functional+owners@googlegroups.com>.

We do not allow: violent language or threats; name-calling; personal attacks; condescension of any form; demeaning language; deliberate intimidation; sexist, racist, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language; and off-list publication of private and/or on-list communication without permission. This applies to all Lambda Ladies sponsored spaces, including this mailing list, our IRC channel and in-person meetups, as well as any other spaces that Lambda Ladies hosts, both online and off. Violators may be placed under additional moderation, removed from the list, and/or barred from attending in-person Lambda Ladies events. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct or you have questions about this policy, please contact the list moderators at <lambda-ladies-functional+owners@googlegroups.com>.
