Lambda Ladies' own [Kelsey Gilmore-Innis](https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis) met up with [Dana McCallum](https://twitter.com/DanaDanger) at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) to find out more about her work with Scala and her functional programming pursuits.

### Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Dana McCallum and I'm a senior engineer at Twitter. I work on the ads API, and I used to work on the client API.

### What language do you work in?

I work in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

### Tell me about your development environment.

I hate all the IDEs that exist right now so I've got this crazy [Rube Goldberg concoction](http://coolmaterial.com/roundup/rube-goldberg-machines/) of githooks & ctags & all that shit, plus BBEdit as a text editor. It all comes together into something that's fairly nice. I get autocompletion and I can navigate between files pretty quickly.

### How long have you been using scala, & what did you use before that?

I've been writing in scala about a year and a half now. Before that I was writing in Ruby, when I was working on the client api here that used to all be written in Ruby. I switched onto a team using Scala because I wanted to learn it and because we're rewriting a lot of our code here into Scala. Being a Ruby programmer here at Twitter is going out of fashion.

### Was that your first functional programming language/exp?

When I was 12 or 13 my parents enrolled me in Intro to Computer Science at Indiana University, which is borderline abusive, I think! (laughter) I learned Scheme in that class, so that was my first functional language. They weren't really teaching it in a functional way, though, cause it was intro CS. It was more basic, like here's what a loop is, things like that. That was my first functional language. I don't think I did any functional programming between then and now, actually.

### Do you like it?

I love it. (interviewer & interviewee high-five) I don't love Scala. I like it all right, but I do love functional programming.

### Do you participate in a language community?

I try to avoid programming communities online, because everyone on the internet is an asshole. I've got no time for it. I've found much better relationships in real life/face-to-face. I can't get involved in that online drama. So I try to focus on actual human relationships between people who know each other. Maybe that's old school.

### What other tools or languages do you think are interesting or want to investigate?

I'm trying to get back into either Scheme or some other kind of Lisp, for my own personal amusement. I started looking into Common Lisp, but I was actually kind of grossed out by its API. I hate to say this, but it's kind of got a PHP stink on it. Just in terms of there's no standardisation for function names. There are functions that will create whole new lists, or ones that will reuse the input list, but there's no standard way to tell. Since I'm looking for something for fun, that's not fun! It turns out Scheme has done really really well on that particular concern. It's totally standardized, everything makes total sense, there's a very systematic approach. So I've been kind of dabbling around with Racket. It's a dialect of Scheme & an environment, so that's been kind of fun. I've been kind of on-and-off dabbling with Go here & there, but I haven't been too blown away by it. It seems like a fancy library with slightly different syntax than C. I don't see that it offers a whole lot on top of other languages.

I've also been doing some arduino stuff. I've always wanted to write something on top of a real time operating system. For most people -- even most programmers -- there's just no reason to use a real time operating system, cause they're usually used for things like computers in cars. I love embedded programming, cause it's just so real! I am moving bits around!

### What's the coolest thing you've ever built?

Ooh, this is my favorite interview question to ask when I'm interviewing candidates, so any Twitter candidates out there, think about that…

My favorite project I've ever done was about 10 years ago I wrote a navigation system for airplanes. It ran on a Palm Pilot with a GPS unit you clipped onto the back of it. I got some data from the military who was publishing all these datasets for airports and so on and so forth, so I had awesome data from them. There's an instrument in an airplane called a horizontal situation indicator, which is just a fancy way of saying that it's a compass that also tells you if you're off course at all. So I built an instrument like that on the Palm Pilot that was tied into the GPS, so you could say something like “I'm in Bloomington, and I want to fly via Indianapolis to Fort Wayne and then to Midland, Michigan." That's an actual trip that I did with this system.

### You fly planes?

Yeah, I'm a pilot.

### That's awesome, and now I think you're a wizard because you can FLY.

I prefer sorceress, but that's okay. So yeah, I haven't topped that yet, even though I work at Twitter.

### Do you have a math background?

Yes and no. I didn't go to college, so my educational background is a little wonky, but I was always way ahead in math in school. I took trig and calculus at the same time and aced them both, and my teacher let me sleep in the classes cause I didn't need the lectures. One of the things that appeals to me about functional programming is that it's got that elegance and that it is sort of, like, academic.

I haven't heard this much lately, but I remember there was a time where I would always hear people say that if you want to be good at programming you have to be good at math. And it's like, well, not really. You don't have to know specific mathematical concepts in order to program, it's more like a style of thinking and being able to think about problems in a certain way and being able to work within a system of rules to get from one place to another. That's really what I think of when I say or hear somebody say that math and programming are related.

### Do you have any advice for women who want to get into functional programming?

It's hard for me to answer questions like that. Somebody was interviewing me for a pilot blog and they asked me the same thing about women getting into flying, and it's just like–I don't really have any advice, just fucking do it. Don't let anybody tell you no.
